# Practice: Express server creating messages from req

In this practice, I continue to create a response that depends on the user request. Also, in this exercise, I practice simple string manipulation to capitalize the first letter of the user supplied name.
Finally, I practiced creating <a> elements to link from the root page to the greeting page.
